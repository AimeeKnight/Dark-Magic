                Name, Work for... heard me on...
                <br>
                Also pretty new...
                <br>
                Before becoming a dev, spent 15 years skating...
                <br>
                Come to realize over the past few years as I've worked to enter this field
                <br>
                Becoming a developer feels a lot like becoming a successful skater.
                <br>
                With that said, I'd like to show something...
                <hr>
                Now, I want to do a quick exercise;
                <br>
                Hands above head, 1 turn. (Confident!)
                <br>
                Bet you guys feel uncomfortable... That's what it's like to be a Jr learning!
                <br>
                I’m comfortable here...
                only because I’ve learned to get comfortable with this feeling! :)
                <br>
                Over and over again I talk to juniors and we always have the same conversation.
                <br>
                I’m not going to say you have to do this... or that... today
                I don't believe in those kind of absolutes...
                <br>
                But I am... going to share what’s worked for me... common things I keep hearing.

                I want to talk about some numbers for minute: (FADE IN 7)
                Right now, for every person in tech looking for a job, there are 3 open openings.
                <br>

                    So, how do we effectively funnel incoming devs to address this?

                    That's one problem boot camps are good at addressing!

                    They're popping up everywhere, churning out highly motivated Jr's,
                    but let's be honest, companies are usually looking for seniors.
                    <br>
                    In order to bridge the gap together, going to talk about what it actually looks like
                    to go from a bootcamp,
                    to full time developer, and what senior devs can do to support the process.
                    <br>
                    We all like to talk about numbers.
                    I challenge you, to look at the solution,
                    and acknowledge what the process actually looks like.

                    Employers probably aren’t hiring you expecting you to solve their most complex problems.

                    The industry is filled with people who've been writing code, and studying CS since they were kids.

                    It's also filled with passionate people who enjoy it as a hobby.

                    When you're entering the field, you've got a lot to prove,

                    One big thing I've noticed over the past few years is how easy it is to forget
                    what you actually know.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) You'll help Jr's on your team immensely, if you frame conversations accordingly.
                    <br>
                    Which means explain things differently to a Jr than you would a Sr.
                    <br>
                    A lot of the time Jr's don’t have the same context to rely on.
                    <br>
                    If you and I were watching the Olympics together and I told you 'a skater cheated their
                    double axel & had a wrap’, you’d have no idea.
                    <br>
                    Instead, I could say to you 'they rotated their foot a 1/4 turn
                    before taking off (cheating),
                    <br>
                    and their leg went above their knee in the air
                    (wrapping) which is poor style’.
                    <br>
                    I might even get up and draw… hint!
                    <br>
                    With the inverse approach:
                    <br>
                    You might not know what a double axel is, so you Google that,
                    <br>
                    then you have to figure out what the heck
                    ‘cheated’ and ‘wrap’ mean.. in that context.
                    <br>
                    Before you know it, what could be explained quickly,
                    turned into a 30 minute rabbit hole for you.
                    <br>
                    You might think this is a pain, but it'll help you grow as you’ll

                    (FADE IN) Project mgmt. is another subtle, but extremely crucial step.

                    Managers & product managers should work together
                    to ensure projects flow smoothly.
                    <br>
                    Jr's are still getting used to being able to gauge timing on projects,

                    <br>
                    Ambiguity can be tough to deal with too.

                    Let's talk about preparing your code base, (FADE IN) specifically with testing.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) Microsoft did a study and found the number of defects decreased 40-90% when they started doing TDD.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) And they initial development time only increased 5-35%

                    Increases confidence making changes for everyone.
                    <br>
                    With a Jr it will serve as docs, & prevent regressions learning the code base.
                    <br>
                    If nothing else, start writing tests in tandem with bug fixes.
                </aside>

                <aside class="notes">
                    As with testing, having code standards, style guides, and linting in place is valuable for everyone,
                    <br>
                    but with a Jr on your team, it means you'll have less to worry about in your code review.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) A really important part of this is comments.

                    Saying goes, those who don’t think they need comments, are usually the worst offenders!
                    <br>
                    Developing a team style guide is also great project for a Jr because it will ensure
                    they understand best practices.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) JSCS makes this easier and helps with docs.
                    <br>
                    Without a doubt teams should be linting as well.
                    <br>
                    (FADE IN) There are things like
